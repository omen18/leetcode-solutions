Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
LeetCode #: 3
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Approach: Dynamic sliding window with hash map storing last seen index of each character. Move `left` pointer to `max(left, char_map[s[right]] + 1)`.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)) where m is size of alphabet

            char_map[char] = right
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
