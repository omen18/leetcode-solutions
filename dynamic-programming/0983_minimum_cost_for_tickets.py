Problem: Minimum Cost For Tickets
LeetCode #: 983
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/

Approach: Dynamic Programming. Maintain `dp` array where `dp[i]` is min cost to travel up to day `i`.
Put travel days in a set. Iterate day `i` from 1 to max_day. If `i` is not a travel day, `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
Else, `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + costs[0], dp[max(0, i-7)] + costs[1], dp[max(0, i-30)] + costs[2])`.
Time Complexity: O(D) where D is max day number
Space Complexity: O(D)
